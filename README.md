Getting started

This repository hosts the code for LWGAL.

1.criteria.py: codes for the evaluation criteria

2.generated_data.py: codes for generating simulation data.

3.LWGAL.py: codes for the proposed approach (LWGAL).

4.relation.py: codes for the calculation of relationship matrix across datasets.

5.sim.py: codes for simulation studies under various scenarios.

6.util.py: codes for some basic functions and alternatives.

Using GWGPL

*note : Running "sim.py" to get the simulation result (under the default settings, the result of Scenario 2 will be obtained),
        but three folders ("estimated_coef", "evaluation_result", "simulation_data") need to create in advance to store the results, where

"simulation_data" : Used to store the simulated data generated in each repeated experiment.

"estimated_coef" : Used to store the coefficient estimation results of different methods.

"evaluation_result" : Used to store the evaluation results of different methods.
